# Queer Reads
> A passion solo project that features a user friendly searchable interface to find novels accumulated by the community of /r/fantasy on Reddit.

This project is all thanks to the Reddit user KristaDBall and the /r/fantasy Reddit community. Together, they put together a spreadsheet of information on LGBTQ+ related books. I found the spreadsheet hard to use, so I decided to make it easier to access by turning it into an application. You can find the original project [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1roLOB8OZm34XjzVyDmH5fyWiPKGYy8i9EzRuhBMZauo/)

Queer Reads lets you search through a database of books using either the searchbar, the checkboxes avaliable, or both! It also gives you information on the items with data from GoodReads
