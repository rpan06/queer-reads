In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women''s lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.<br /><br />A wife refuses her husband''s entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store''s prom dresses. One woman''s surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella Especially Heinous, Machado reimagines every episode of <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i>, a show we naively assumed had shown it all, generating a phantasmagoric police procedural full of doppelgangers, ghosts, and girls with bells for eyes.<br /><br />Earthy and otherworldly, antic and sexy, queer and caustic, comic and deadly serious, <i>Her Body and Other Parties</i> swings from horrific violence to the most exquisite sentiment.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<br /><br />It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.<br /><br />One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<br /><br />Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called <i>The Way of Kings</i>. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<br /><br />Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar''s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan''s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<br /><br />The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<br /><br />Speak again the ancient oaths:<br /><br /><b>Life before death.</b><br /><b></b><b>Strength before weakness.</b><br /><b></b><b>Journey before Destination.</b><br /><b></b><br /><b></b>and return to men the Shards they once bore.<br /><br />The Knights Radiant must stand again.', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388184640l/7235533.jpg'), ('B0756HL8LR', 502, 'Witchmark', 'Witchmark', 1793, 'C.

It''s hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?<br /><br />This is Clary''s first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It''s also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace''s world with a vengeance when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight?

Shoulder to shoulder with her <i>parabatai</i>, Julian Blackthorn, she patrols the streets of Los Angeles, where vampires party on the Sunset Strip, and faeries—the most powerful of supernatural creatures—teeter on the edge of open war with Shadowhunters. When the bodies of humans and faeries turn up murdered in the same way Emma’s parents were when she was a child, an uneasy alliance is formed. This is Emma’s chance for revenge—and Julian’s chance to get back his brother Mark, who is being held prisoner by the faerie Courts. All Emma, Mark, and Julian have to do is solve the murders within two weeks…and before the murderer targets them.<br /><br />Their search takes Emma from sea caves full of sorcery to a dark lottery where death is dispensed.

A series of strange events links the lives of an ordinary woman, a bookseller in St. Paul''s, and the great writer Christopher Marlowe, as the Faerie Queen and her court invade London in search of the Queen''s son, the reborn King Arthur. Marlowe must become in effect a detective, and Alice, strangely favored by the fairies, must become a heroine in a struggle against evil forces. The culmination of this extraordinary fantasy, a battle between the opposing dragons of good and evil, is certainly one of the most weird and enchanting events in all contemporary fantasy. Strange Devices of the Sun and Moon is a big, delicious fantasy adventure filled with strange creatures and ordinary people, famous characters, and mysterious historical doings.

The Stars Change: an erotic science fiction novel-in-stories. On a South Asian-settled university planet, tensions are rising, and as they reach the brink of interstellar war, life (and sex) continues. Humans, aliens, and modified humans gather at the University of All Worlds in search of knowledge... and self-knowledge... but the first bomb has fallen and the fate of this multicultural, multispecies mecca is in question. Some people will seek solace in physical contact, some will look for spiritual answers, while others will find their strength in community, family, and love. Some will rush home to make love to their wife. Or wives. Or husbands. Or indeterminate gender human and/or alien partners. Others will be forced to decide where they stand -- what is worth fighting for, or maybe even worth dying for. In The Stars Change, author Mary Anne Mohanraj presents a multi-layered, thought-provoking, and far-reaching work on sexuality and the connections between people--whether male or female, human or alien. The Stars Change is part space opera, part literary mosaic of story, poem, and art. It is fitting that a book that emphasizes the power of community was funded through Kickstarter. Begun as a project entitled "Demi Monde," The Stars Change is the result of the money raised by supporters that went to pay for not only the art and illustrations in the book, but the author''s time, allowing her to focus on writing for that crucial interval. About the Author: Mary Anne Mohanraj is the author of Bodies in Motion, Sri Lankan-American linked stories (HarperCollins), as well as Silence and the Word, The Best of Strange Horizons (ed.), Aqua Erotica (ed.), and The Poet''s Journey (a children''s fantasy picture book). Bodies in Motion was a finalist for the Asian-American Book Awards and has been translated into six languages. Mohanraj received an Illinois Arts Council Fellowship in Prose (2006). Mohanraj lives in Chicago, where she teaches creative writing and post-colonial literature at the University of Illinois; she also taught at the Clarion workshop in 2008. She is a graduate of Clarion West, and holds an MFA and a Ph.D. in creative writing.', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385994902l/18841806.jpg'), ('9781857987447', 388, 'Ash: A Secret History', '-', 3335, 'Mary Gentle', '4.11', 'Fantasy', 'Novel', 'For the beautiful young woman Ash, life has always been arquebuses and artillery, swords and armour and the true horrors of hand-to-hand combat.

She had escaped...but the cost of her newfound freedom was crime and deception, and she paid it over and over again, until she had become someone she loathed.<br /><br />Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and creating a new future. <br /><br />But to start again, Lore required Spanner''s talents--Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner''s game one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van Oesterling to be paid. Only by confronting her family, her past, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be...', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386923585l/270259.jpg'), ('9780765338051', 993, 'Everfair', '-', 836, 'Nisi Shawl', '3.28', 'Fantasy', 'Novel', 'An alternate history / historical fantasy / steampunk novel set in the Belgian Congo, from noted short story writer Nisi Shawl.  <i>Everfair</i> is a wonderful Neo-Victorian alternate history novel that explores the question of what might have come of Belgium''s disastrous colonization of the Congo if the native populations had learned about steam technology a bit earlier.

The romantic love that blossoms between Renarda the Fox and Lapine the Rabbit is doubly wrong in the eyes of the dictatorial Great Horned Owl who presides over their forest realm - wrong because it''s interspecies and because it''s between two females. The Owl (not a wise bird here) commands all the forest creatures to spy on one another and to report any "differentness." By splitting up the forest''s denizens into two races, First Ones and second-class "refugees" the Owl sows antagonism and fear, fostering a network of spies and snitches. The lovers, once discovered, are charged with "crimes against nature," arrested and banished to separate rehabilitation camps, until a bumbling apprentice wizard, Albertus the Lesser, exposes the Owl as an impostor and transforms the forest into a haven of tolerance and love.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to.

But though she lives in Paradise, arranging a match is full of traps and pitfalls for the unwary ... or perhaps just for her. <br /><br />Nikola Striker, Lord of Fireholt, expects he''ll wed -- someday. But not now, and never to a rich icicle of a woman like Miss Vasilver. No matter how much his parents might want the match, or his house might need her dowry. Besides, he has his own problems -- most of them people who need his help as a mind-healer. <br /><br />Lord Justin Comfrey, Viscount of Comfrey, would be more than happy to help Striker with his financial troubles, and not just to ensure that Miss Vasilver''s dowry doesn''t tempt Striker into marriage. If only he could find some way to make his proud, stubborn friend accept the money! <br /><br />Can three people of such different temperaments ever find their way to a more perfect Paradise?', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438466942l/25788113.jpg'), ('B01LZ9XS3B', 505, 'The Moon Etherium', 'Etherium', 3860, 'L.

When Cyril''s cover is blown on a mission, however, he must become a turncoat in exchange for his life. Returning to Amberlough under the Ospies'' watchful eye, Cyril enters a complex game of deception.

Some will rush home to make love to their wife. Or wives. Or husbands. Or indeterminate gender human and/or alien partners. Others will be forced to decide where they stand -- what is worth fighting for, or maybe even worth dying for. In The Stars Change, author Mary Anne Mohanraj presents a multi-layered, thought-provoking, and far-reaching work on sexuality and the connections between people--whether male or female, human or alien. The Stars Change is part space opera, part literary mosaic of story, poem, and art. It is fitting that a book that emphasizes the power of community was funded through Kickstarter. Begun as a project entitled "Demi Monde," The Stars Change is the result of the money raised by supporters that went to pay for not only the art and illustrations in the book, but the author''s time, allowing her to focus on writing for that crucial interval. About the Author: Mary Anne Mohanraj is the author of Bodies in Motion, Sri Lankan-American linked stories (HarperCollins), as well as Silence and the Word, The Best of Strange Horizons (ed.), Aqua Erotica (ed.), and The Poet''s Journey (a children''s fantasy picture book).

Like a shaman, Monette, the novelist, poet, essayist, AIDS activist and National Book Award winner (Becoming a Man) who died of AIDS in 1995, creates a magic space within this animal fable, which resonates with wisdom and grace. This posthumous offering is an amazingly tender parable of same-sex love full of political overtones sounding Monette''s lifelong themes of social justice, the need for tolerance of diversity and the fluid nature of sexual selves. The romantic love that blossoms between Renarda the Fox and Lapine the Rabbit is doubly wrong in the eyes of the dictatorial Great Horned Owl who presides over their forest realm - wrong because it''s interspecies and because it''s between two females. The Owl (not a wise bird here) commands all the forest creatures to spy on one another and to report any "differentness." By splitting up the forest''s denizens into two races, First Ones and second-class "refugees" the Owl sows antagonism and fear, fostering a network of spies and snitches. The lovers, once discovered, are charged with "crimes against nature," arrested and banished to separate rehabilitation camps, until a bumbling apprentice wizard, Albertus the Lesser, exposes the Owl as an impostor and transforms the forest into a haven of tolerance and love. Monette''s complex, quicksilver prose aims at the heart and never misses. His entrancing tale is illustrated throughout with luminous, spectral pictures that enhance the moonlit aura of enchantment.

A place he lived for nearly eight years now. His life was safe, simple and ordinary; none of which was ever enough for his best friend, Jace. Jace was turning two decades and in the eyes of munfolk, that meant he would become a man. Only Jace wasn''t of mun and that put him in danger. It would possibly even end his life.<br /><br />Knowing he would be forced to leave town, Mae was unwilling to let him go alone. He had secrets too, and it was time he did something about it. Their journey will send them on a unique quest. From being chased by a hag, to flying on winged horses and even a confrontation with a vampire, they come across friends and foes of all creatures. The only problem is, nothing is black and white, and not everyone is as friendly as they seem. Haunted by the curse that follows his bloodline, it soon becomes apparent to Mae that no matter what you do or how far you run, your past will always catch up to you.<br /><br />The tale of two, cursed for destruction.<br />One with the strength to kill and the other, the courage to resist.', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1453160451l/28598815.jpg'), ('9780312872083', 457, 'The Chosen', 'The Stone Dance of the Chameleon', 1793, 'Ricardo Pinto', '3.53', 'Fantasy', 'Novel', 'Young Carnelian has spent his entire life alone with his father, who years ago rejected the savage cruelty of the Masters of Osrakum and was sent into exile.

To the surprise of both the veteran "Dogs" and her fellow "puppies," Beka requests duty in the Lower City. The Lower City is a tough beat. But it''s also where Beka was born, and she''s comfortable there.<br /><br />Beka gets her wish. She''s assigned to work with Mattes and Clary, famed veterans among the Provost''s Dogs. They''re tough, they''re capable, and they''re none too happy about the indignity of being saddled with a puppy for the first time in years. What they don''t know is that Beka has something unique to offer. Never much of a talker, Beka is a good listener. So good, in fact, that she hears things that Mattes and Clary never could - information that is passed in murmurs when flocks of pigeons gather ... murmurs that are the words of the dead.<br /><br />In this way, Beka learns of someone in the Lower City who has overturned the power structure of the underworld and is terrorizing its citizens into submission and silence. Beka''s magical listening talent is the only way for the Provost''s Dogs to find out the identity of this brutal new underlord, for the dead are beyond fear. And the ranks of the dead will be growing if the Dogs can''t stop a crime wave the likes of which has never been seen.
