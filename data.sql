In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women''s lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.<br /><br />A wife refuses her husband''s entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store''s prom dresses. One woman''s surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<br /><br />It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.<br /><br />One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<br /><br />Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called <i>The Way of Kings</i>. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<br /><br />Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar''s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan''s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<br /><br />The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<br /><br />Speak again the ancient oaths:<br /><br /><b>Life before death.</b><br /><b></b><b>Strength before weakness.</b><br /><b></b><b>Journey before Destination.</b><br /><b></b><br /><b></b>and return to men the Shards they once bore.<br /><br />The Knights Radiant must stand again.', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388184640l/7235533.jpg'), ('B0756HL8LR', 502, 'Witchmark', 'Witchmark', 1793, 'C.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.<br /><br />Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.<br /><br />source: georgerrmartin.com', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436732693l/13496.jpg'), ('9780978986162', 343, 'Lord of the White Hell: Book One', 'Caledonian Series', 3841, 'Ginn Hale', '4.06', 'Fantasy', 'Novel', '<p>Kiram Kir-Zaki may be considered a mechanist prodigy among his own people, but when he becomes the first Haldiim ever admitted to the prestigious Sagrada Academy, he is thrown into a world where power, superstition and swordplay outweigh even the most scholarly of achievements.

The radical One State Party—nicknamed the Ospies—is gaining popular support to unite Gedda\'\'s four municipal governments under an ironclad, socially conservative vision.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees with the Ospies\'\' philosophy, including master spy Cyril DePaul and his lover Aristide Makricosta, smuggler and emcee at the popular Bumble Bee Cabaret. When Cyril\'\'s cover is blown on a mission, however, he must become a turncoat in exchange for his life. Returning to Amberlough under the Ospies\'\' watchful eye, Cyril enters a complex game of deception. One of his concerns is safeguarding Aristide, who refuses to let anyone—the crooked city police or the homophobic Ospies—dictate his life.<br /><br />Enter streetwise Cordelia Lehane, top dancer at the Bee and Aristide’s runner, who could be the key to Cyril’s plans—if she can be trusted. As the twinkling lights of nightclub marquees yield to the rising flames of a fascist revolution, these three will struggle to survive using whatever means—and people—necessary. Including each other.\', \'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1462547662l/29939270.jpg\'), (\'9780887621116\', 794, \'Salt Fish Girl\', \'-\', 514, \'Larissa Lai\', \'3.69\', \'Science Fiction\', \'Novel\', \'"Salt Fish Girl" is the mesmerizing tale of an ageless female character who shifts shape and form through time and place.

Told in the beguiling voice of a narrator who is fish, snake, girl, and woman - all of whom must struggle against adversity for survival - the novel is set alternately in nineteenth-century China and in a futuristic Pacific Northwest.<br /><br />At turns whimsical and wry, "Salt Fish Girl" intertwines the story of Nu Wa, the shape-shifter, and that of Miranda, a troubled young girl living in the walled city of Serendipity circa 2044. Miranda is haunted by traces of her mother\'\'s glamourous cabaret career, the strange smell of durian fruit that lingers about her, and odd tokens reminiscient of Nu Wa. Could Miranda be infected by the Dreaming Disease that makes the past leak into the present?<br /><br />Framed by a playful sense of magical realism, "Salt Fish Girl" reveals a futuristic Pacific Northwest where corporations govern cities, factory workers are cybernetically engineered, middle-class labour is a video game, and those who haven\'\'t sold out to commerce and other ills must fight the evil powers intent on controlling everything.

A senior in high school, he’s still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery. <br /><br />He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn’t bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin’s fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart. <br /><br />At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren’t black and white, love and sex aren’t simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price.\', \'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1313772941l/6101718.jpg\')
