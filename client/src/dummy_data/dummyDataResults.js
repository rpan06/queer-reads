While her work has earned her comparisons to Karen Russell and Kelly Link, she has a voice that is all her own. In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women's lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.<br /><br />A wife refuses her husband's entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store's prom dresses. One woman's surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella Especially Heinous, Machado reimagines every episode of <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i>, a show we naively assumed had shown it all, generating a phantasmagoric police procedural full of doppelgangers, ghosts, and girls with bells for eyes.<br /><br />Earthy and otherworldly, antic and sexy, queer and caustic, comic and deadly serious, <i>Her Body and Other Parties</i> swings from horrific violence to the most exquisite sentiment. In their explosive originality, these stories enlarge the possibilities of contemporary fiction.",

    "longDescription": "Hexes in the subway station. Monsters in alleyways. Rituals in the back room at your local pizza place. Magic is everywhere you look in the city, if you look closely enough.<br /><br />These eleven stories take the glamour off of cities as you know them to reveal the magic beneath. From selkies and sweets in Saint Thomas to secret-spilling potions in Brasília to faeries and werewolves in Toronto, you’ll find that magic and the myriad kinds of people who create it are right where they always have been: everywhere around you. Explore the world as you’ve never seen it, or maybe the way you’ve always known it to be—full of magic and people as diverse and as beautiful as the world itself.<br /><br />ur·ban fan·ta·sy (ər-bən fan-tə-sē), n.<br /><br />Describes a work that is set primarily in the real world and contains aspects of fantasy. Although stories may be set in contemporary times, this characteristic is not necessary for the fiction to be considered urban fantasy, as works of the genre may also take place in futuristic and historical settings, real or imagined.<br />(Wikipedia)<br />More than anything, UNDERCITIES looks for stories that weave the magic of urban fantasy together with positive interpretations of race and queer sexuality. Fantasy is not homogenous; it is as diverse and imaginative and real as the LGBTQ+ authors and authors of color who create it. It is a place where anything can happen—and why not make it a space where everyone and anyone can overcome obstacles, win battles, and experience happenings beyond their wildest dreams?<br /><br />Literature has always been a place where reality meets the fantastical. UNDERCITIES intends to reflect that. The stories presented in UNDERCITIES are reflections of our world as they could and should be; they combine the impossible daring of magic with the experiences of the people with whom we share the world and put the voices of LGBTQ+ creators and creators of color at the forefront of these narratives. Each short story presented in UNDERCITIES presents a different point of view and a different experience—and each of these stories is as diverse and incredible as the authors who created them.",
